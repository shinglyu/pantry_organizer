Pantry Organizer is a simple Web App that allows you to keep track of the items in your pantry. You can add items along with their expiry dates, and the app will highlight items that are expiring or have expired.

## Features

- Add items to your pantry with an expiry date
- View all items in your pantry
- Items close to their expiry date are highlighted in orange
- Items past their expiry date are highlighted in red

## Why No Frameworks?

We've chosen to avoid using any frameworks for this application to keep it as simple as possible. This makes the app lightweight and easy to understand, even for those new to web development. It's a great example of what can be achieved with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There's no need for any build steps or server setup - it's that simple!
